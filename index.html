<div>A float div with overflow auto.<br>
You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

(Just long sentence.) Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.
<span class="a">Love </span>
&nbsp;is not love A float div Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! it is an ever-fix'ed
with overflow mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It
auto. A float is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's
unknown, although his heighth be taken. <span class="a">Love's</span>  not
div with Time's fool, thouh rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's
compass come; <span class="a">Love </span>  alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But
bears it out even to the edge of doom: if this be error and upon me
proved, I never writ. nor no man ever loved.
